# How to install
If you do not wish to use the exe file I provided, you can build this program yourself! 
In order to do so, make sure you have the newest version of python 3 installed and all the required libraries mentioned in the libraries file.
Once you have downloaded the .zip of this repository, unpack it. Now run pyinstaller with the "ChaosCounter.spec" file by entering 

"pyinstaller ChaosCounter.spec"

Make sure you either navigated to the folder where the spec file is located first or instead use the full path to the file.
